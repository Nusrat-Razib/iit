                The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of networked devices that collect, exchange, and analyse data to automate activities and deliver insights. When integrated with artificial intelligence (AI), IoT devices can go beyond data collection to execute intelligent activities and make real-time data-driven choices. This collaboration between IoT and AI boosts the intelligence of AI systems, allowing them to interact with the real environment in a dynamic and responsive way. However, assessing the extent of AI intelligence in IoT applications highlights its limitations and problems.
                <br><br>
AI in the context of IoT is frequently used to handle and analyze enormous amounts of data created by connected devices, allowing for predictive maintenance, anomaly detection, and intelligent automation. In smart homes, for example, AI-powered IoT systems may analyze sensor and camera data to learn human preferences, optimize energy use, and increase security. Similarly, in industrial settings, AI-enabled IoT devices track equipment performance in real time, identifying failures before they happen and reducing downtime. According to Gubbi et al. (2013), "the integration of AI with IoT allows for enhanced decision-making capabilities, making systems more responsive and adaptive to changing conditions"
<br><br>
However, the intelligence of AI in IoT is heavily reliant on the quality and variety of data it gets. AI algorithms require massive volumes of data to learn and generate accurate predictions, but they also require diverse and high-quality data to generalize effectively across different circumstances.
This dependency raises concerns about data privacy, security, and the possibility of biased or incomplete data leading to inaccurate or poor conclusions. For example, an AI-powered IoT system that monitors health data from wearable devices may struggle to deliver correct recommendations if the data is biased toward specific demographics or the sensors fail to collect all relevant health markers.
<br><br>
Another restriction of AI in the Internet of Things is the current absence of full autonomy and general intelligence. Most AI-powered IoT systems excel at specific tasks but lack the broad contextual awareness and adaptability associated with human intelligence. For example, a smart thermostat in a home may learn optimal heating schedules based on human behavior, but it cannot adapt to fundamentally new duties, such as predicting future energy prices or integrating with unrelated smart devices, without intentional reprogramming. This constraint demonstrates that, while AI can make IoT systems appear clever, their skills are limited to predetermined parameters and settings.
<br><br>
Furthermore, the inclusion of AI in IoT systems raises questions about decision-making openness and accountability. AI models, particularly those based on deep learning, can behave like "black boxes," making judgments that are difficult for users or developers to understand. This opacity can be problematic in key applications such as self-driving cars or smart healthcare systems, where knowing the reasoning behind AI-driven decisions is critical for safety and confidence.
<br><br>
Finally, AI improves the functionality and intelligence of IoT devices, allowing for more responsive, efficient, and personalized solutions across a wide range of industries. However, the intelligence of AI in IoT is fundamentally constrained by data dependency, specific task specialization, and a lack of general cognitive capacities. As AI advances, resolving these limits will be critical to realize the full promise of intelligent IoT devices while guaranteeing their safe and ethical deployment.
