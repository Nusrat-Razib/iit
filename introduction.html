            <h2>What is Artificial Intelligence: How Intelligent is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
            <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that focuses on developing machines capable of doing activities that would normally need human intelligence. These tasks include learning, thinking, problem-solving, perception, and language comprehension. The topic of "how intelligent is artificial intelligence?" is tricky since AI comprises a wide range of technologies, from simple rule-based systems to advanced machine learning algorithms capable of mimicking certain features of human cognition.
                <br>
                At its foundation, artificial intelligence is about creating systems that can absorb information, make decisions, and learn from experience. Early AI systems were limited to carrying out predefined instructions, while modern AI uses machine learning and deep learning techniques to adapt and improve their performance based on data. Russell and Norvig (2020) define artificial intelligence as "the study of agents that receive percepts from the environment and perform actions" (Russell & Norvig, 2020). This concept emphasizes AI's ability to interact with its surroundings, process inputs, and perform actions aimed at achieving certain goals.
